I'm an enthusiastic software developer based in London, currently working at [Activate Media](http://activate.co.uk). My passion for computers and software development in addition at 5+ years of study in IT, working in 2 different countries on many projects made me a **full stack developer** focused on web development.

I love to create and deliver good and innovative software.

Now, my interests are focused on `node.js`, `machine learning`, `bots` and `conversational UI apps`.
