![Andrea Falzetti]({{site.url}}/img/about.jpg)

I am an enthusiastic **Full Stack JavaScript Developer** based in *London* <i class="em em-uk"></i>. I have been professionally designing and developing web applications for over 6 years.

I'm currently focused on **Node.js**, **React**, **Microservices architecture**, **Serverless**, conversational UI, **Chat Bots** and I get very excited if you mention _machine learning_. I have started my career learning Pascal, C++, VB6, **C#** (see my Xbox Indie Game [Xstronauta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlXwYpwPmVg)), **Java**, Android SDK and finally PHP and the LAMP stack which I have used at work for more than 5 years.

### Current role
I am currently working at [Activate](http://activate.co.uk) where my role is to estimate, design and lead the development of web and mobile platforms.

### Previous roles
If you are interested to know more about my past, check out [my Developer Story](http://stackoverflow.com/story/andreafalzetti) on StackOverflow or [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreafalzetti).

### Confs & Communities
I like to stay up to date with the latest technologies and best practices so if you attend any conference or meetup in London or around the Europe you will probably meet me. If you need some inspiration look at my [meetup.com profile](https://www.meetup.com/members/195831274/) to see some interesting communities where I often hang around, they are mainly about: `JS`, `ML`, `AWS`, `node`, `React / React Native`, `Neo4j`, `Chat Bots`, `AI` and much more.

I think it's incredibly useful to meet, talk and share with people that have your same passion for technology and have different backgrounds, probably with the same issues as you, and maybe some solutions you don't know yet!

Upcoming conferences that I will attend:

- **[Couchbase Day (NoSql database)](https://www.couchbase.com/nosql-resources/events/2017/april/couchbase-day-london)**, London <i class="em em-uk"></i>
- **[GraphConnect Europe 2017](http://graphconnect.com/)**, London <i class="em em-uk"></i>
- **[Elastic{ON} Tour](https://www.elastic.co/elasticon)**, London <i class="em em-uk"></i>
