I am Software Engineer based in London, UK. I am passionate about building products and tools that bring value to people. I have been developing software since 2010.

In my current role I focus on building one of the best **developer experience** tools out there: [Gitpod](./_posts/2022-04-22-hello-gitpod.md).

Previously, I worked as **Staff Platform Engineer** at [DAZN](https://engineering.dazn.com/), the world's first truly dedicated live sports streaming service. Initially focusing on our product's backend, building features and highly scalable APIs using AWS & Node.js, My interest in building products and tools, eventually made me move to Platform & Tooling where I focus on internal Developer Experience.

`AWS`, `JS`, `Node`, `Go`, `Terraform`, `DX`, `serverless`, `resilience`, `chaos`, `React`.

### It all started with Pascal

My first programming language was, indeed, Pascal, then I learnt C, VB6, C# (I have also published an Xbox indie game called [Xstronauta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlXwYpwPmVg)), Java, for a while I built Android apps, of course PHP with the LAMP stack which I have used at work for more than 5 years.
