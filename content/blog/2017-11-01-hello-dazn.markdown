Today, I am happy to announce that I have joined [DAZN](https://dazn.com) *(pronounced "Da Zone")*, a revolutionary sports streaming service.

After four years of service at [Activate](http://activate.co.uk), I have decided to try a different experience. In my time at Activate, as a developer, I had the opportunity to learn and grow a lot. Activate provided me with an extraordinarily **flexible** and **challenging** environment. Working with their clients and partner startups was a chance to strengthen my skills, learning every day, experimenting and introducing new technologies to the team. The company has supported me both professionally and personally during this time, and I am very grateful for that. Thanks, Activate.

For the past two years, I have been mainly working with JavaScript and in particular, with **React** & **Node.js**, building innovative software for startups. It has been a great journey which today led me to the decision of moving to something different.

Hello DAZN.
