title: New plugin for Passwordless.net based on Node-Cache
---

Yesterday I've published my first [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passwordless-nodecache) and I'm feeling quite proud. I've been programming in NodeJS for a few months now and I have to say, I love the concept behind **npm**. The fact that you can rely on _a bunch of packages ready to be used_, installable in few seconds that are often really well written, tested and documented and last but not least open-source, is just great.

So I've decided that I had to contribute with a plugin for [passwordless.net](passwordless.net) that supports [node-cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cache). My plugin, **passwordless-nodecache** is available on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passwordless-nodecache) and it's listed in the [Plugins page](https://passwordless.net/plugins) of passwordless.

The source code is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/andreafalzetti/passwordless-nodecache).

Have fun!
