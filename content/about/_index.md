üëã I'm Andrea, a Staff Software Engineer and AWS Community Builder based in London, UK. I am passionate about building products and tools that bring value to people. I have been crafting software since 2010.

Since 2021 I have been working within the Developer Experience space, empowering other developers have a better experience doing their work, every day.

I am passionate about creating products, startups, building companies, coding, traveling, making bread and pizza üçï.

### How I work

Although I have strong understanding the whole stack, I prefer working as a backend engineer. I like contributing to the entire development lifecycle from planning, architecture, coding, provisioning cloud infrastructure, CI/CD automation, testing, on-call, writing docs and giving tech-talks. I can also do front-end work but it's not my strength.

I have experience mentoring and leading company-wide initiatives, including interviewing and hiring other engineers.

I've experience working at enterprise level companies with millions of req/s as well as early stage startups, including bootstrapping my own SaaS startup.

and much more.

### It all started with Pascal

My first programming language was, indeed, Pascal, then I learnt C, VB6, C# (I have also published an Xbox indie game called [Xstronauta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlXwYpwPmVg)), Java, for a while I built Android apps, of course PHP with the LAMP stack which I have used at work for more than 5 years.
