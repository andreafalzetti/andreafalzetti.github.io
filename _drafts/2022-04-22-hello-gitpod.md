I meant to write this blog post a month ago, but.. life happened :)

On my blog, I generally write technical articles rather than talking about my personal life, but 4 years ago I wrote [Hello DAZN](https://andreafalzetti.github.io/blog/2017/11/01/hello-dazn.html) and I kind want to keep up with the tradition, so.. Hello Gitpod ðŸ§¡

At the beginning of March, this year, I've joined [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io) âœ¨

I've sent the last few years at DAZN, focusing on DevX (Developer Experience), empowering the fellow engineers to get their job done smoothly and efficiently. Back in 2018, I was already speaking about [DevX tooling](https://andreafalzetti.github.io/blog/2018/10/25/10-tools-to-boost-your-developer-experience.html). It's thanks to [Cirpo and the DAZN DX team](https://medium.com/dazn-tech/developer-experience-dx-at-dazn-e6de9a0208d2) that I realised how much I liked the subejct.

I heard about Gitpod, the very same day GitHub announced Codespaces and my colleague [Lou](https://openupthecloud.com/?s=about+me) announced he would join Gitpod.

Since that day, I've become a user, a customer, a community member of Gitpod because I immediately saw the benefits of a cloud development environment. I started using it for day-to-day work, and I mostly automated my entire development workflows with Gitpod.

In fact, I am writing this very blog post which requires `jekyll` to run, using Gitpod.

Writing a blog post with `jekyll` often requires you to locate the project on your machine, open your favourite IDE, open the terminal, launch jekyll, etc. 

With Gitpod, all I have to do, is press this green button :)

And in matters of seconds, I am ready to write my blog post, because Gitpod runs for me the commands like:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --drafts
```
