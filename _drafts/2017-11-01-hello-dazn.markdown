Today, I am happy to announce that I have joined [DAZN](https://dazn.com), a revolutionary sports streaming service.

After four years of service at [Activate](http://activate.co.uk), I have decided to take my career a step further. In my time as a Full Stack Developer at Activate I had the opportunity to learn and grow a lot. Activate provided me with an extraordinarily flexible and challenging environment. Working with their clients and partner startups gave me the chance to strengthen my dev skills and also experiment and introduce new technologies to the team.

For the past two years, I have been constantly working with JavaScript and in particular, with the **React** & **Node.js** stack building innovative software for startups.
